# Housing Market Analysis

This project performs housing market analysis using the Redfin housing market
dataset. It allows the user to understand the housing market trends and make informed
decisions on buying a house. As we are using big data that requires replication and
sharding for faster processing, our application appreciates NoSQL deployment rather
than RDBMS.
