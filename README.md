# Housing Market Analysis

This project performs housing market analysis using the Redfin housing market
dataset. It allows the user to understand the housing market trends and make informed
decisions on buying a house. As we are using big data that requires replication and
sharding for faster processing, our application appreciates NoSQL deployment rather
than RDBMS.

Housing_market_analysis.ipynb - Contains Python code to connect to the NoSQL database and provides an interface to perform various actions like serach, view, and compare

command_to_update_database.ipynb - This Python file gives commands to perform various operations such as insert, delete, and update on the database.
